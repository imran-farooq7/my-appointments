00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Ray] There's two reasons why,

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:05,000
if I had to learn only one JavaScript framework,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,006
it would be React.

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,001
Now first, the speed at which

5
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:11,001
it's dominated the industry is amazing.

6
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:12,008
If I was looking for a job today

7
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:15,005
as a front end or full stack developer,

8
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:19,000
chances are it's on the list of preferred skills.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,004
But the second reason is more important.

10
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a lot of fun to code in.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
React makes things that are annoying,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
like managing the virtual DOM, trivial.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,003
Hey there, this is Ray Villalobos,

14
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:32,006
senior staff instructor at LinkedIn,

15
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:36,000
and I created this course as a quick introduction to React

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,004
that will teach you how it works in a practical way.


17
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:41,002
I'm using React Hooks in this course,

18
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:44,002
the most modern way of working with the library.

19
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,005
I'm assuming you know the basics of HTML,

20
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:49,007
CSS, and JavaScript, and that's about it.

21
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,000
Now, we're going to build a simple application

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,001
that will get you some experience with React

23
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,004
and show you why it's worth your time.

24
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:59,000
So if you're ready to build an interactive project,

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
let's get started.
