00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] Let's take a look at the tools we'll need

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
to get started installing a React project

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,007
with Create React App.

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:07,007
Now before you get started,

5
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,008
you'll need to have some tools pre-installed

6
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:12,008
on your computer to work on this project.

7
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:15,005
First, you'll need a copy of Git installed.

8
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:17,006
A Git is a version control system

9
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:21,002
that lets you keep track of and collaborate on projects.

10
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:23,004
If you're on a PC, when you install Git,

11
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:26,006
you have the option of installing an app called Git Bash,

12
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:30,004
which lets you use Linux commands on a PC.

13
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:32,004
You'll also need a copy of Node.js,

14
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:34,007
which is used to manage the project.


15
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:38,001
A couple of optional tools will also make your life easier.

16
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:39,006
First, I highly recommend

17
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,002
that you install the React Developer Tools.

18
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:45,000
They allow you to inspect what's going on with React

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,006
in real time.

20
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll be using Visual Studio Code for this project,

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,006
so there's a couple of extensions that will really help.

22
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:53,007
The first is a series of React Snippets

23
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:56,006
that will make your life easier when working with React.

24
00:00:56,006 --> 00:01:00,001
The second is a series of snippets for JSX,

25
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,001
the language that React projects are based on.

26
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:04,005
You can create a React app

27
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:07,003
with a tool called Create React App.


28
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:09,007
It's a much simpler way to create projects,

29
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:11,005
but it does require that you have npm,

30
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:15,002
which comes with Node.js 5.2 or higher.

31
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:16,004
If you have a previous version

32
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:18,003
of the Create React App project,

33
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:21,004
you can uninstall it with the command seen here.

34
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:24,000
Otherwise, you can use your terminal application

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,005
to run the following commands.

36
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:29,001
First, I like to put my projects on the desktop

37
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,004
but you can put them wherever you want.

38
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:33,004
Then you'll use an npx

39
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:36,003
and then use the Create React App command

40
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:39,000
and give your application a name.


41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,003
I'm going to call mine reactinterface

42
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:44,002
then we'll switch over to the reactinterface folder

43
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:46,000
and run npm start.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,007
Let's go ahead and try that in a terminal.

45
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,009
I'm using a hyper right here

46
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,001
but you can use the macro S terminal, Git Bash,

47
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:55,002
or any other tool of your liking.

48
00:01:55,002 --> 00:02:00,000
So I'm going to issue a cd~/Desktop,

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,001
that will put my terminal in the desktop

50
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:07,000
and then I'll use the npx create-react-app

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,005
and create the reactinterface project.


52
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,009
I'm going to hit return,

53
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,005
wait for the installation to complete.

54
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:17,003
Once that's done,

55
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,003
you can see the different commands that you can use.

56
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:21,005
If you see yarn,

57
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:25,005
that means that you have another application called yarn.

58
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:26,007
You can look for that,

59
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:29,005
or if you have npm, you can use npm,

60
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:31,007
but you can use any of these commands that you want.

61
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:35,005
I'm going to cd into the reactinterface folder,

62
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:39,000
and once in there I can run the npm start command,

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
or you can run yarn start.


64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,005
Now, if you do have something running on the default port,

65
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:46,007
like I do, it's going to ask you this,

66
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:49,003
just go ahead and say yes,

67
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,007
and it'll start your browser

68
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:58,000
with the sample application showing.
